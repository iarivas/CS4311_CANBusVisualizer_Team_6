Will update project settings and state as more

Currently creates new project on createProject 
API endpoint call

import projectConfig

class projectManager():

    currentProject: projectConfig.project = None #Will create project object to store information off file
    projectState = None #temp file call
    
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        pass

    def openProject():
        return

    def archiveProject():
